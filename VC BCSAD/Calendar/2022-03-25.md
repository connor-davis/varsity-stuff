### Manchester encoding schemes

### Bipolar (Alternative Mark Inversion)
- Here 0 is no signal; 1 can either be positive or negative voltage.
	- The advantage here is that there is no loss of synchronization with long strings of 1's

### Shift keying techniques

#### Amplitude shift keying
The simplest modulation technique is amplitude shift keying. A data value of  1 and a data value of 0 are represented by two different amplitudes of a signal.
