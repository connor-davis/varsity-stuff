## Data and Signals
### Objectives
- Distinguish between data and signals
- Explain the advantages of digital data and signals

1. Data transferred over a network can be categorised as, data and signal.
2. **Data** has to be converted into the appropriate **signals** before transmission over a network.
3. To transfer data from one point to a another via physical wire or radio waves, the data must be converted into a signal.
4. Signals are the electric or electromagnetic impulses used to encode and transmit data.

### examples of signals:
- A transmission of a telephone conversation over a telephone line
- The downloading of a web page as it is tranferred over the cable between your internet service provider and your home computer.

- Conversion is performed by modulation techniques.

### Analog vs. Digital

Data and signals can exist either in analog or digital form.

Analog data and analog signals are represented as continuous waveforms that can be at an infinite number of points between some given minimum and maximum.

The minimum and maximum values are seen as voltages.

- Data and signals analog form.
- Noise occurs as an analog waveform.

Digital data and digital signals are composed of a discrete or fixed number of values. The digital data takes on the form of binary 1s and 0s.

A type of digital signal
- Square wave
- Square waves have high and low voltages which takes on only two discrete values

- Even though digital signals are said to have no noise, they technically can't have zero noise.

### Advantages of digital data and signals over analog data and signals
- Digital signal passes through a filtering device that removes a significant amount of the noise and leaves the original digital signal intact.
- Electronic equipment dictates the type of signals the wire can transmit.

### The basic components of a signal
#### Amplitude
- The amplitude of a signal is the height of the wave above (or below) a given reference point.
- Volts, amps, watts.
- Denote the current level of the signal (amps) or the power level of the signal.

#### Frequency
- It is the number of times a signal makes a complete cycle within a given time frame.
- The length, or time interval, of a cycle is called a **period**. (1/frequency)

- Telephone is created to transmit a human voice, the telephone system transmits signals in the range of 300Hz to 3400Hz
- Spectrum is the range of frequencies that a signal spans from minimum to maximum
- The bandwidth of a signal is the absolute value of the difference between the lowest and highest frequencies
- An electronic device usually has an **effective bandwidth** that is less than its bandwidth
- The effective bandwidth helps to reduce the noise.

#### Phase
- It is the position of the waveform relative to a given moment of time, or relative to time zero.
- Oscillates up and down
- It can change direction

It can change direction by different degrees

### Loss of signal strength
The loss of power, or loss of signal strength, is called attenuation.

Decibel (dB) is a relative measure of signal loss or gain and is used to measure the **logarithmic loss or gain of signal**.

Amplification: signal gains in decibels when a signal is amplified by an Amplifier.

### Data transfer speed
- This is the amount of digital data that is moved from one place to another in a given time.
- Measured in bits per second.
- Higher data bandwidth equals to transfer rate.
