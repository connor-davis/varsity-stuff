#### Combining Structures
- All logic problems can be solved using only sequence, selection and loop
- Structures can be combined in an infinite number of ways
- **Stacking Structures**
	- Attaching structures end-to-end

- Any individual task or step in a structure can be replaced by a structure
- **Nesting structures**
	- Placing on in another
	- Indent the nested structures statements
- **Block**
	- Group of statements executed

- **Priming Input**
	- Reads the first input data record
	- Is outside the loop that reads the rest of the records
	- Helps keep the program structured
- Analyze a flowchart for structure one step at a time
- Watch for unstructured loops that do not follow this order
	- First ask a question
	- Take action based on the answer
	- Return to ask the question again

- **Use structured programming for:**
	- *Clarity* - unstructured programs are confusing
	- *Professionalism* - other programmers expect it
	- *Efficiency* - most languages support it
	- *Maintenance* - other programmers find it easier to read
	- *Modularity* - easily broken down into modules
- Structured programming is sometimes called **goto-less programming**

- Spaghetti code
	- Statements that do not follow rules of structured logic
- Three basic structures
	- Sequence, selection and loop
	- Combined by stacking and nesting
- Priming input
	- Statement that reads the first input value prior to starting a structured loop

1.    Your downloadable files for Chapter 3 include DEBUG03-01.txt, DEBUG03-02.txt, and DEBUG03-03.txt. Each file starts with some comments that describe the problem. Comments are lines that begin with two slashes (//). Following the comments, each file contains pseudocode that has one or more bugs you must find and correct.
