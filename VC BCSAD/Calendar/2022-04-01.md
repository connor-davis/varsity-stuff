The height: h
The time: t
Formula: h = -2t^2 + 7t - 4

How long will it take?

h = -2t^2 + 7t - 4
0 = -2t^2 + 7t - 4
0 = -2t^2 + 7t - 4
0 = -(2t^2 -8t + t + 4)
0 = -(2t(t - 4) - 1(t - 4))

2t = -1 or t = 4
t = -1/2 or t = 4

### Network media
All communications media enables the transfer of data.
These mediums are categorised as:
1. Physical or conducted (fibre optics cables)
2. Radiated or wireless  media (cell phones)

### Conducted media
- Twisted pair wire
- Coaxial cable
- Fibre-optic cable

### The characteristics of a Twisted pair wire
It comes as two or more pairs of single-conductor copper wires that have been twisted around each other. Each wire is encased within plastic insulation.

The twisting of the wires is done to reduce the amount of interference between the wires.

A current or signal in one wire can produce an unwanted current or signal, called **crosstalk**, hence the twisted wires.

The specifications known as Category 1-7, abbreviated as CAT 1-7.

The standard telephone wire and has few or no twists.
Issues:
- Electromagnetic noise
- It carry analog voice or data at low speeds (less than or equal to 9600 bps).

It used for telephone circuits and some low-speed LANs. It has some twisting
- Less noise
- Examples: T-1 and ISDN lines.
- T-1 - transmits voice or data at 1.544 Mbps
- ISDN - transmits (voice or data) from 64kbps to 1.544 Mbps

It was designed to transmit 10 Mbps of data over LAN for distances up to 100 meters.

Issues:
- The signal weakens (attenuation) as the wire covers more distance
- A repeater is used to replicate of the original signal

#### Shielded and Unshielded twisted pair
Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is the most common form of twisted pair; none of the wires are wrapped with a metal foil or braid.

![[Pasted image 20220401161350.png]]

Shielded twisted pair (STP), in Category 5 to 6, is a form in which a shield is wrapped around each wire individually, around all the wires together or both.

The shielded twisted pair can provide a higher level of isolation from that interference.

It is not a good idea to strap a twisted pair wiring to a powerline (damaging amounts of electromagnetic interference) that runs through a room or through walls.

#### The characteristics of Coaxial Cable
It is a single wire (usually copper) wrapped in a foam insulation, surrounded by a braided metal shield, and then covered in a plastic jacket.

The braided metal shield is very good at blocking electromagnetic signals

It is good at carrying analog signals with a wide range of frequencies
E.g. telephones

##### Baseband

It uses digital signalling in which the cable carries only one channel of data

It used to be the interconnection of switches within a LAN. Here the baseband cable would typically carry one 10- to 100Mbps.

##### Broadband

It transmits analog signals and is capable of supporting multiple channels of data simultaneously.

It transmits cable television. Many cable companies offer 100 or more channels.
