# Number line to differenciate between positive and negative integers
Created: 2022-03-07 15:04

In mathematics, it is sometimes helpful to talk about **groups of things**, which are called **sets**

- Natural numbers are numbers from **one to infinity**
- Whole numbers are numbers from **zero to infinity** without fractions
- Integers are numbers from **negative infinity to positive infinity** and can be represented on a **number line**

### Absolute value and the number line
The **distance of a number's place on the number line and 0** is called the number's **absolute value**.

- To write the absolute value of a number, we use short vertical lines (|) on either side of the number, ie, |3|

### Adding integers
Since positive integers are the same as natural numbers, adding two positive integers is the same as adding two natural numbers.

### Adding integers with different signs
There are two cases to cocnsider when **adding integers**:

1. When the signs are the *same*, you add the absolute values of the addends and use the same sign
2. When the signs are *different*, you find the *difference* of the absolute values and use the *same sign* as the addend with the greater absolute.

### Additive Identity

### Rational Numbers and Real Numbers
There are other numbers that can be found on a number line, too. When you include all the numbers that can be put on a number line, you have the **the real number line**.

**Rational numbers** are numbers that *can be written as a ratio of two integeres.* Rational numbers can be negative.

### Comparing rational numbers
When two whole numbers are graphed on a number line, the *number to the right on the number line is always greater than the number on the left*. The same is true when comparing two integers or rational numbers.

### Irrational numbers and real numbers
**Irrational numbers** cannot be written as the ration of two integers. Any *square root of a number that is not a perfect square* is **irrational**.

Irrational numbers are most commonly written in one of three ways:
1. A root
2. Using a special symbol
3. A non-repeating/digits that never form a repeating pattern (1.41422113562), non-terminating decimal (5.3 or 5.33...)

If a number is *terminating or repeating*, it must be **irrational**
If it is both *non-terminating and non-repeating*, the number is **irrational**
