# Additive and Multiplicative Principles
Created: 2022-05-25 13:15

The additive principle states that if event A can occur in m ways, and event b can occur in n disjoint ways, then event "A or B" can occur in m + n ways.

### Counting with sets
The additive principle (with sets) states that a given two sets A and B, if A n B = 0

| \|A U B\| | =   | \|A\|   | +   | \|B\|   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\|A x B\|** | =   | \|A\|   | x   | \|B\|    |
