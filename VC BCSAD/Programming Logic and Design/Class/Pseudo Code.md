# Pseudo Code
Created: 2022-03-03 13:10

Four standards
- Begin with **start** and end with **stop**
- Start and Stop must be in-line with each other.
- When a module name is used it must be followed by parenthesis.

```pseudocode
start
	input myValue1
	input myValue2

	set myAnswer = myValue1 / myValue2

	output myAnswer
stop
```
