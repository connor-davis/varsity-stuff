| Data type | Variable Name | Value |
| --------- | ------------- | ----- |
| num       | myValue       | = 20  |
| num       | myAnswer      |       |

### Understanding Data Types
- Data type describes:
	- What values can be held by the item
	- How the item is stored in memory
	- What operations can be performed

### There are two types of constants
- Numeric constant
	- Contains numbers only
	- Number does not change
- String constant
	- Also known as alphanumeric values
	- Contains both alphabetic characters and numbers
	- Strings are enclosed in quotation marks

```pseudocode
num MONTH_OF_YEAR = 12
num myValue

String QUIT = "222" // Any value can be assigned here.
```

Note: *A constant variable will always be in uppercase!*

- Variables are named in pascal case.
- Constants are named in uppercase.

### Numeric Variables
- Holds digits
- Can perform mathematical operations on it

### String variable
- Can hold text
- Letters of the alphabet
- Special characters such

### Type safety
- 

- An identifier is a variables name
- Programmer chooses reasonable and descriptive names for variables
- Programming languages have rules for creating identifiers
	- Most languages allow letters and digits
	- Some languages allow hyphens
	- Reserved keywords are not allowed
- Variable names are case sensitive

### Variable naming conventions
- Camel casing
- Pascal casing
	- Variables that are named with first letter in each word being capitalized
- Hungarian notation
- Snake casing
	- separated by an underscore
- Mixed case with underscores
- Kebob case
	- separated with a hyphen

```java

= // assignment/binary operator
  // operates from right to left
  // lvalue is the result to the left of the assignment
&&
!=
||
==


```

- Initializing a variable - declare a starting value
	- num yourSalary = 14.55
- Gargbage - a variables unknown value
- Named constant
	- Similar to a variable
- Magic number
	- Unnamed constant
